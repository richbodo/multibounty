	<h2>Welcome to multi bounty, a place where anyone can publicize things that they would like to fund.</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Each bounty has a title and a description of what the conditions for redemption should be.<br/><br/>

			For example,
			"submit a pull request to github.com/zvibo/multibounty that provides a snazzy css skin for the meteor site."<br/><br/>
		</li>
		<li>Any member of the public can submit a request to receive the bounty.

			<br/><br/>Each submission should include a receiving address to where the money should be sent, as well as some text describing how this submission meets the conditions for redemptions. (For example, "see pull request #4").
